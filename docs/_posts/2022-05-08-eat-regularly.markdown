### Short description
Intermittent fasting and eating at regular hours during the day leads to 30% longer life.

Restricting daily calories consumption by 30% leads to 10% longer life.

Longer life is associated with less inflamation processes, so not only you will live longer, but also have less allergic responses.


### Conclusion
The obvious conslusion is that you need to get up and go to sleep at regular hours, preferably at [10-11 pm](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/the-sweet-spot-for-bedtime-between-10-p-m-and-11-p-m-is-best-for-heart-health#How-to-get-to-sleep-at-the-right-time). 

Going to sleep and waking up at the same time allows your [circadian rhytms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm) to be constant relative to 24 hour clock.
The fasting hours are based on your circadian rhytms and when they are constant - you can just eat on same schedule during the day without worrying about your rhytsm.

If you are not going to sleep & waking up at the same hours - it will be hard to eat at the same times relative to your circadian rhythms.
